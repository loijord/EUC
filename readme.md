This is a development site of EUC toolkits written in Python.

For production use, go to https://loijord.github.io/EUC/

It's written in Python using Pycharm and Jupyter Notebook integration. 
All the scripts I upload sit in Jupyter Notebooks. Then I run:

``` jupyter nbconvert --to html --no-input --TagRemovePreprocessor.remove_cell_tags <my_tag> <my.ipynb>```

and [convert my notebooks in HTML](https://mljar.com/blog/jupyter-notebook-hide-code/) to make it ready for production use.
